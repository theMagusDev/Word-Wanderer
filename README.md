# Word Wanderer

## Unique memorization technique

The application implements a special technique called "back translation".  It is an effective method for memorizing new words when learning a foreign language. 
+ Back translation allows you to better understand the meaning and usage of a word in context. It helps to relate the words in the foreign language to your mother tongue and creates a better understanding of how to use the words.
+ The use of back-translation allows for a better understanding of grammatical constructions and rules of the language.
+ The constant comparison of words between foreign and native languages creates connections and helps strengthen the memorization of new words.
